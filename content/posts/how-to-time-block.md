# Aimlessly Living

There is a routine in life. You started to notice that something is not quite right. There are things that you wanted to do but haven't gotten around to doing, there are goals you've wanted to accomplish but haven't done. Heck, even things you wanted to try but just haven't found the time. That time was taken from you.

Yep, and you gave it away. Taken by the barrage of distractions ("squirrel"), obligations and general complexities of your life. It is mostly the case, speaking to archetypes who work a typical salary job in a knowledge work environment.

> We've allowed ourselves to get encumbered by obligations and openned ourselves up for distractions

You have a choice to make, will you let this constant barrage berate you into a complacency and settling for unsettled desires? It is up to you. Perhaps this season is a bit tough and you don't want that; that's okay, but perhaps there is something knawing at you, in the back of your mind you know it is possible, but don't know how or even why. You can feel it. You need to take your time back. You can't, that time is lost. But the second best time to plant a tree is now. What will you do now?

> "Squirrel!"

It's about guarding your time from the distractions, the unnecessary obligations and giving room for the complexities of life. Imagine a garden where you'd like to grow some fruits.

You'd first terraform the soil to a good condition, then you'd put a fence up to prevent bugs and critters from damaging the plant. It's about "blocking" things that are unnecessary so that the things that do matter (you) can flourish and grow. You may even notice other plants that grow along side your fruit plant, you may think that is fine but in reality it too is taking away nutrients from the soil, nutrients that would have gone to making more fruit. Time blocking, is your way of saying to the world. "No, this matters. This is important to me. I am important."

# How to Time Block

Time Blocking is very simple, every day you terraform your day and make room for what needs to happen and when. You allocate time for it and during that time, only do what you made time for. Everything else is a distraction, a weed that could take time away from what you see.

You can set up weeding sessions, where all you do is tackle the weeds that sprung up during the day. This could be meetings that overrun, urgent things for the day.

## This will not be perfect

You will eventually encounter that gopher that dug underneath your fence, or your crop contracted a disease. That's okay, you are okay. What this is designed for is to give you a framework for deciding when things will get done. I find myself updating my time block planner a few times a day to adjust to unplanned work and handle distractions I could not avoid.

# What Does it look like in action?

Here is an example:

- 0600 to 0800: wake up, dress for the day, drink coffee, read Daily Stoic
- 0800 to 1045: address to dos, reviews
- 1100 to 1300: run and lunch
- 1300 to 1600: address feedback, more reviews
- 1600 to 1700: finish up work, meeting
- 1700 to 1900: dinner, cleanup, walk with family
- 1900 to 2200: read chapter of Thrawn Acendency, bed

Do i follow this exactly? Nope. However, this does give me an idea of when things will/should get done. Those things I've listed are a combination of the things I have to do and the things I get to do. I've effectively blocked time so that the things that are important to me have a place to grow. Because otherwise, if you are like me, you let the weeds take over, until you've got nothing left.

Hope this was useful, work on your defence, be fruitful!
